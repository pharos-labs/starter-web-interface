# Pharos Controls Starter Web Interface

The Starter Web Interface is designed to serve as a basic custom web interface for use with [Pharos Designer control products](https://www.pharoscontrols.com/designer/).

The Starter Web Interface can be used as is, or as a template for you to build your own custom interface. Control elements are dynamically generated based on information in your Pharos Designer 2 project file without the need to add triggers.

This progressive web application or PWA is responsive and will automatically adjust to accommodate most desktop and mobile device screen sizes. It has also been optimized for Apple devices using their Web App mechanism. This version of the starter interface utilizes API 6.0 and compatible with Designer 2.9 and higher. The API setting can be found on the Project tab in Designer under the project properties tab.
